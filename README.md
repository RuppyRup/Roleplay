# Roleplay
This is a very basic role playing game for coding practice
The original file was from SoloLearn
The files:
  main.py is the file that runs the main program and takes the inputs
  Actions.py provides the functions for the actions used in main.py
  game_objects.py defines the objects used in the game
  RWOOPGame.py - Is a test file
  RWOOPGame_master.py was the main file for use before the game was split up into separate modules
I added the following:
  characters
  more actions
  the ability to create new characters
  a random event that may or may not occur at the end of each input.
